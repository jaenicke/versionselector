Delphi Version Selector
=======================

This tool can be used to open Delphi project files with the correct version of Delphi.


Supported versions of Delphi
----------------------------
At the moment I use Delphi 10.4 Community Edition to develop this tool.
Delphi 1 to 11.1 are supported by the tool to open projects created with these versions.

You would like to contribute?
-----------------------------
You can send your commits as pull requests. This is the easiest way for you since I'll do
the merging if neccessary.

Currently there is one contribution:
  2018: KodeZwerg - Support up to Delphi 10.2
